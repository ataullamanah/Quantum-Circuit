# Quantum Circuit

A unique quantum-inspired puzzle game where players manipulate qubits using quantum gates to match a target pattern. Built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

In **Quantum Circuit**, you apply quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z) to a set of qubits to transform their states to match a target quantum state. Each level presents a new challenge with increasing complexity. Perfect for learning basic quantum computing concepts in a fun, interactive way!

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Quantum-inspired mechanics with Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), and Pauli-Z (Z) gates
- Progressive difficulty with increasing levels
- Score tracking
- Minimalistic UI with responsive design

## How to Play

1. Observe the **Current State** and **Target State** of the qubits.
2. Use the quantum gates:
   - **Hadamard (H)**: Randomly flips the qubit state.
   - **Pauli-X (X)**: Inverts the qubit (0 to 1, or 1 to 0).
   - **Pauli-Z (Z)**: Sets a qubit to 0 if it's 1 (no effect if already 0).
3. Match the current state to the target state to complete the level.
4. Click **Reset** to restart the current level.
